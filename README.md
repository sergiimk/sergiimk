### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sergii Mikhtoniuk ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack polyglot software architect with experience ranging from embedded circuit design, compilers, computer graphics and GPGPU, to API and framework design, highly scalable distributed systems, and micro-service architectures. 

I'm an active contributor to a wide range of open-source projects, and a long-time Open Data geek.

I'm the creator of [Open Data Fabric](http://opendatafabric.org/) and [kamu-cli](https://github.com/kamu-data/kamu-cli) - the world's first decentralized real-time data warehouse and a global supply chain for data.

Currently building [Kamu](https://kamu.dev) - a company that will bring humanity's next big leap towards data-driven decision making, help the world to make sense of its growing supply of data, and enable true global collaboration around data on the same level as currently seen in software.

Always happy to connect with like-minded people who are passionate about data and software.
